# FemaleDominanceReproduction_MetaAnalysis

This repository contains the preregistration, R code, and data for the project "The effect of dominance rank on female reproductive success in social mammals" by Shivani, Elise Huchard & Dieter Lukas.

The [Preregistration](https://dieterlukas.github.io/Preregistration_MetaAnalysis_RankSuccess.html) has been recommended by [PCI Ecology](https://doi.org/10.24072/pci.ecology.100056), and the final analyses are reported in the [post study markdown](https://github.com/dieterlukas/FemaleDominanceReproduction_MetaAnalysis/blob/trunk/Manuscriptfiles/PostStudy_MetaAnalysis_RankSuccess.Rmd) file. The code in the file will automatically load all necessary input data from this repository.

The [input file](https://github.com/dieterlukas/FemaleDominanceReproduction_MetaAnalysis/blob/trunk/Inputfiles/InputData_MetaAnalysis_FemaleDominanceReproduction.csv) file contains 444 effect sizes from 187 studies on 86 mammal species linking the rank of females to their reproductive success, plus associated variables describing the source studies.

The [simulate data file](https://github.com/dieterlukas/FemaleDominanceReproduction_MetaAnalysis/blob/trunk/Inputfiles/SimulatedData_MetaAnalysis_FemaleDominanceReproduction_March2020.csv) file has the same structure as the actual data file, but was filled with random data to test the R code prior to the submission of the preregistration for peer review.
